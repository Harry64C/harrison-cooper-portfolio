        The purpose of this project is to improve peopleâ€™s access to air quality information. We
        take raw sensor data from strategically placed monitors around the Salton Sea area then
        process and display it on a website created for the project.
      </p>

        Data visualization is done using Python scripts after making API calls in Python.

        I developed most of the front-end elements with html / css and created a dashboard that is
        populated by queries to our SQL database
